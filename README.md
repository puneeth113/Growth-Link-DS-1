# **Titanic Survival Prediction**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival using **machine learning models**. By examining key features such as **age, gender, ticket class, and fare**, the analysis identifies factors influencing survival and develops predictive models to classify passengers as **survivors or non-survivors**.  

## **Task Objectives**  
- Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset.  
- Handle missing values and perform feature engineering.  
- Explore and visualize survival trends based on different factors.  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest**).  
- Compare model performance and optimize predictions.

## **Steps to Run the Project**  

1. **Set up the environment**  
   - Install Python (>=3.8) and required dependencies.  
   - Run:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Load and preprocess the dataset**  
   - Execute `data_preprocessing.py` to handle missing values and feature encoding.  
     ```bash
     python src/data_preprocessing.py
     ```

3. **Explore and visualize data**  
   - Run `visualization.py` to generate survival trends and feature distributions.  
     ```bash
     python src/visualization.py
     ```

4. **Train and evaluate models**  
   - Run `model_training.py` to train models and compare their performance.  
     ```bash
     python src/model_training.py
     ```

5. **Check results**  
   - Model evaluation metrics will be stored in the `results/` folder.  

## **Evaluation Criteria**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.  
- **Model Performance:** Comparing different classifiers and ensuring a well-balanced accuracy score.  
- **Code Structure & Readability:** Clean, modular, and well-commented code for maintainability.  
- **Visualization & Insights:** Effective use of visualizations to support findings.
