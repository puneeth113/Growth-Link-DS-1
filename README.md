# **Titanic Survival Prediction**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival using machine learning. The analysis covers **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training**, all within a **single Jupyter Notebook**.  

## **Task Objectives**  
- Understand key survival factors from the Titanic dataset.  
- Perform **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).  
- Visualize survival patterns and correlations.  
- Train machine learning models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest**) for prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance and optimize results.  

## **Project Structure**  
```
Titanic_Survival_Prediction/
│── titanic_analysis.ipynb      # Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
│── data/                       # Dataset (CSV file)
│── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## **Steps to Run the Project**  

1. **Set up the environment**  
   - Install Python (>=3.8) and Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Install dependencies:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Open and run the Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `titanic_analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.  

3. **Explore results**  
   - The notebook includes **data visualization, model evaluation metrics, and key insights**.  

## **Evaluation Criteria**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Efficient handling of missing values, encoding, and feature selection.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Clear visualizations and survival insights.  
- **Model Performance:** Well-evaluated models with appropriate accuracy metrics.  
- **Notebook Readability:** Well-structured code with markdown explanations.
